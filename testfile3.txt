Please don't scroll past this. This Thursday, for the 1st time recently, we humbly ask you to defend Wikipedia's independence. 98% of our readers don't give; they look the other way. If you donate just $2.75, or whatever you can this Thursday, Wikipedia could keep thriving for years. Most people donate because Wikipedia is useful. If Wikipedia has given you $2.75 worth of knowledge, take a minute to donate. Show the editors who bring you neutral and verified information that their work matters. If you are one of our rare donors, you have our gratitude and we warmly thank you. Your donation matters.
